**üöó Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System**

**üìå Project Summary**  
This system presents an **IoT-enabled Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System** designed to minimize road mishaps caused by fatigue. Leveraging **computer vision and machine learning**, it continuously monitors the driver's alertness and sends real-time notifications when signs of drowsiness are detected.

**üîç Key Highlights**  
- **Live Eye & Face Monitoring**: Utilizes OpenCV and Dlib for facial landmark tracking to monitor eye activity.  
- **Drowsiness Detection Mechanism**: Implements the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** technique to recognize signs of fatigue.  
- **IoT Connectivity**: Triggers alerts through email, SMS, or mobile app notifications when drowsiness is detected.  
- **Video Feed Access**: Provides live video streaming for remote observation.  
- **Cloud Backup**: Offers storage of alert logs and snapshots in the cloud.  
- **Secure Access**: Includes a login system to restrict unauthorized access.

**üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:  
  - OpenCV (for image processing)  
  - Dlib (for detecting facial landmarks)  
  - TensorFlow/Keras (optional ‚Äì for deep learning-based enhancements)  
  - Flask (to handle API and backend services)  
- **Hardware Components**:  
  - Raspberry Pi or similar IoT board  
  - IR/USB Camera  
  - Buzzer or speaker for sound alerts  
- **Cloud Platforms**: Firebase, AWS, or Google Cloud (for alerting and data storage)

🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System

📌 Project Summary
This system presents an IoT-enabled Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System designed to minimize road mishaps caused by fatigue. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning, it continuously monitors the driver's alertness and sends real-time notifications when signs of drowsiness are detected.

🔍 Key Highlights

Live Eye & Face Monitoring: Utilizes OpenCV and Dlib for facial landmark tracking to monitor eye activity.

Drowsiness Detection Mechanism: Implements the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) technique to recognize signs of fatigue.

IoT Connectivity: Triggers alerts through email, SMS, or mobile app notifications when drowsiness is detected.

Video Feed Access: Provides live video streaming for remote observation.

Cloud Backup: Offers storage of alert logs and snapshots in the cloud.

Secure Access: Includes a login system to restrict unauthorized access.
